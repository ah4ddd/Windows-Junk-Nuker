## 🔧 What It Destroys

This batch script **aggressively deletes junk files** that clog your system but **leaves your settings and browsers untouched**:

- 💥 `%TEMP%` — User temp files  
- 💥 `C:\Windows\Temp` — System temp files  
- 💥 `C:\Windows\Prefetch` — Prefetch cache  
- 💥 `$Recycle.Bin` — Empties the Recycle Bin for all users  
- 💥 `*.log` files under `C:\Windows` — Useless log clutter  
- 💥 Windows Error Reports — `ReportQueue` & `ReportArchive`  

Also:

- 🧠 Kills `explorer.exe` before cleanup to unlock locked files  
- ♻️ Recreates all cleaned folders to avoid system issues  
- ✅ Restarts `explorer.exe` once it’s done

## 🔒 What It **Doesn't** Touch

- ❌ Browsers, cookies, history, saved passwords  
- ❌ Your installed apps or personal files  
- ❌ Registry or system configuration  
- ❌ Critical Windows system files
